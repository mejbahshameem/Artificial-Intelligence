1. Just run "check.m" to compare between two images
   for exact macthing
2. The image file "mushfiq.png" is an exact cropped 
   image of "cricketteam.png" so it will match
3. If "untitled.png" is used for matching with 
   "cricketteam.png", then it will not match because
   it is not taken accurately from the main image "cricketteam.png".
