1. Open "digitRecog.m" and run it digitRecog(digit)
   by passing the digit number as parameter
2. "ex3data1.mat" variable X is containing the hand written digit 
    pictures value(Total 5000 rows)
3. In "ex3data1.mat" variable y(Total 5000) is containing the digit number
   for all X
4. In y the number of each digit is 500. For example,the image
   0-500 in X is the digit 0,the image 501-1000 in X is the digit 1,
   the image 2501-3000 in X is the digit 5.
5. Hence if the input function is called by digitRecog(2892) the output
   should be 5, as it is in 2501-3000 range and it was the image data of 
   picture of a handwritten digit "5"
